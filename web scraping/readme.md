This will be my readme.

I love that the internet allows you to access more data than you can imagine.
Web scraping makes this access possible. Web scraping scripts generally visit websites and extract specific data that you assign it to collect. 
Without scripting, this process would be very tedious for a human; accurately visting the intended url, finding and copying the data, pasting it into an output file <b>FOR EVERY URL</b>.
