Calculate each user's average session time. A session is defined as the time difference between a page_load and page_exit. 
For simplicity, assume a user has only 1 session per day and if there are multiple of the same events on that day, 
consider only the latest page_load and earliest page_exit. 
Output the user_id and their average session time
